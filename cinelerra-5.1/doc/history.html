<H1>The history of Cinelerra
</H1><P>



A long time ago there was a heroine who didn't belong but through the
power of a magic slipper briefly joined the ranks of the accepted
majority.  Cinelerra was opposed by almost every Linux user at the time
of its inception.  Windows is a general purpose computing platform. 
Users are supposed to install their own software on it and use it for
more than one complicated task.  Linux is not a general purpose
computing platform.  Linux is far more suited for a single, very simple
task and preconfiguration in dedicated hardware.<P>

Cinelerra, however, is designed to run on Linux and in a general
purpose, windowed environment with other programs.  For most users this
is heresy but a small number of users may still find Cinelerra useful.
