<H1>Secrets of Cinelerra: Configuration</H1>
</CENTER><P>

Because of the variety of uses, Cinelerra can not be run optimally
without some intimate configuration for your specific needs. Very few
parameters are adjustible at compile time.  Runtime configuration is
the only option for most configuration because of the multitude of
parameters.<P>

Go to <B>settings->preferences</B> and run through the options.<P>

<A NAME=audioout>
<B>AUDIO OUT:</B><P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
These determine what happens when you play sound from the timeline.<P>

<B>SAMPLES TO READ FROM DISK:</B> Cinelerra uses a pipeline for
rendering audio. The first stage is reading large chunks of audio from
disk, the samples to read from disk.  This is followed by processing
small fragments in a virtual console.<P>

<B>SAMPLES TO SEND TO CONSOLE:</B> - The second stage is rendering
small fragments through the virtual console to the sound driver. A
larger value here causes more latency when you change mixing parameters
but gives more reliable playback.<P>

Some sound drivers don't allow changing of the console fragment so
latency is unchanged no matter what this value is.<P>

<B>VIEW FOLLOWS PLAYBACK:</B> - Causes the timeline window to scroll
when the playback cursor moves out of view.  This can bog down the X
Server.<P>

<B>USE SOFTWARE FOR POSITIONING INFORMATION:</B> - Most soundcards and
sound drivers don't give reliable information on the number of samples
the card has played. When playing video you need this information for
synchronization. This option causes the sound driver to be ignored and
a software timer to be used for synchronization.<P>

<B>AUDIO PLAYBACK IN REALTIME:</B> - Back in the days when 150Mhz was
the maximum, this allowed uninterrupted playback on heavy loads. Now
you'll probably only need it for playing video and audio when the load
is to high for uninterrupted audio.<P>

<B>AUDIO DRIVER:</B> - There are many sound drivers for Linux.  This
allows selecting one and setting parameters specific to it.  Some of
the common parameters for a sound driver are <P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>DEVICE PATH:</B> - Usually a file in the <B>/dev/</B> directory
which controls the device.<P>

<B>BITS:</B> - The number of bits of precision Cinelerra should set
the device for.  This sometimes has a figuritive meaning.  Some sound
drivers need to be set to 32 bits to perform 24 bit playback and won't
play anything when set to 24 bits.  Some sound drivers need to be set
to 24 bits for 24 bit playback.<P>

<B>CHANNELS:</B> - The number of channels Cinelerra should set the
device for.  Regardless of the number of channels in the project, the
number of channels set here will be written to the device.  When this
is set to 2 and the project has 1 channel you'll hear sound through the
left speaker and not centered as expected for a monaural project.  When
this is set to 1 and the project has 2 channels you'll hear the left
channel centered and not 2 channels mixed together.<P>

<A NAME=videoout>
<B>VIDEO OUT</B><P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

These determine what happens when you play video from the timeline.<P>

<B>FRAMERATE ACHIEVED:</B> - The number of frames per second being
displayed during playback.<P>

<B>SCALING EQUATION:</B> - The algorithm used in all video resizing in
the virtual console.  This doesn't affect scaling to the size of the
compositor window.<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>NEAREST NEIGHBOR ENLARGE AND REDUCE:</B> - lowest but fastest
quality.  Produces jagged edges and uneven motion.<P>

<B>BICUBIC ENLARGE AND BILINEAR REDUCE:</B> - highest but slowest
quality.  For enlarging a bicubic interpolation is used, which blurs
slightly but doesn't reveal stair steps.  For reduction a bilinear
interpolation is used, which produces very sharp images and reduces
noise.  The bilinear reduced images can be sharpened with a sharpen
effect with less noise than a normal sized image.<P>

<B>BILINEAR ENLARGE AND BILINEAR REDUCE:</B> - when slight enlargement
is needed a bilinear enlargement looks better than a bicubic
enlargement.<P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>PRELOAD BUFFER FOR QUICKTIME:</B> - The Quicktime/AVI decoder can
handle CDROM sources better when this is around 1000000.  This reduces
the amount of seeking.  For normal use this should be 0.<P>

<B>VIDEO DRIVER:</B> - Normally video on the timeline goes to the
compositor window during continuous playback and when the insertion
point is repositioned.  Instead of sending video to the Compositor
window the video driver can be set to send video to another output
device during continuous playback.  This doesn't affect where video
goes when the insertion point is repositioned, however.<P>

Various parameters are given for Video Driver depending on the driver.<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE> 

<B>DISPLAY:</B> - The is intended for dual monitor
displays.  Depending on the value of Display, the Compositor window
will appear on a different monitor from the rest of the windows.<P>

<B>DEVICE PATH:</B> - Usually a file in the <B>/dev/</B> directory
which controls the device.<P>

<B>SWAP FIELDS:</B> - Make the even lines odd and the odd lines even
when sending to the device.  On an NTSC or 1080i monitor the fields may
need to be swapped to prevent jittery motion.<P>

<B>OUTPUT CHANNEL:</B> - Devices with multiple outputs may need a
specific connector to send video on.<P>

<B>PORT:</B> - The IEEE1394 standard specifies something known as the
<B>port</B>.  This is probably the firewire card number in the system
to use.<P>

<B>CHANNEL:</B> - The IEEE1394 standard specifies something known as the
<B>channel</B>.  For DV cameras it's always <B>63</B>.<P>

<A NAME=audioin>
<B>AUDIO IN:</B><P>

These determine what happens when you record audio.<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>RECORD DRIVER:</B> - This is used for recording audio in the Record
window.  It may be shared with the Record Driver for video if the audio
and video are wrapped in the same stream.  It takes variable parameters
depending on the driver.  The parameters have the same meaning as they
do for playback.<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>DEVICE PATH:</B> - Usually a file in the <B>/dev/</B> directory
which controls the device.<P>

<B>BITS:</B> - The number of bits of precision Cinelerra should set the
device for.  This sometimes has a figuritive meaning.  Some sound
drivers need to be set to 32 bits to perform 24 bit recording and won't
record anything when set to 24 bits.  Some sound drivers need to be set
to 24 bits for 24 bit recording.<P>

<B>CHANNELS:</B> - The number of channels Cinelerra should set the
device for.  Regardless of the number of channels in the record
operation, the number of channels set here will be read from the
device.  When this is set to 2 and the record operation has 1 channel
you'll record the left speaker and not a mix of the left and right
speakers as expected for a monaural project.  When this is set to 1 and
the project has 2 channels you'll record the left and right channels
mixed into the left speaker and not 1 channel spead across two
speakers.<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>SAMPLES TO WRITE AT A TIME:</B> - Audio is first read in small
fragments from the device.  Many small fragments are combined into a
large fragment before writing to disk.  The disk writing process is
done in a different thread.  The value here determines how large the
combination of fragments is for each disk write.<P>

<B>SAMPLE RATE FOR RECORDING:</B> - Regardless of what the project
settings are.  This is the sample rate used for recording.  This should
be the highest the audio device supports.<P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>


<A NAME=videoin>
<B>VIDEO IN:</B><P>

These determine what happens when you record video.<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>RECORD DRIVER:</B> - This is used for recording video in the Record
window.  It may be shared with the Record Driver for audio if the audio
and video are wrapped in the same stream.  It takes variable parameters
depending on the driver.  The parameters have the same meaning as they
do for playback.<P>

<B>FRAMES TO RECORD TO DISK AT A TIME:</B> - Frames are recorded in a
pipeline.  First frames are buffered in the device.  Then they're read
into a larger buffer for writing to disk.  The disk writing is done in
a different thread as the device reading.  For certain codecs the disk
writing uses multiple processors.  This value determines how many
frames are written to disk at a time.<P>

<B>FRAMES TO BUFFER IN DEVICE:</B> - The number of frames to store in
the device before reading.  This determines how much latency there can
be in the system before frames are dropped.<P>

<B>USE SOFTWARE FOR POSITIONING INFORMATION:</B> - Video uses audio for
synchronization but most soundcards don't give accurate position
information.  This calculates an estimation of audio position in
software instead of the hardware for synchronization.<P>

<B>SYNC DRIVES AUTOMATICALLY:</B> - For high bitrate recording the
drives may be fast enough to store the data but Linux may wait several
minutes and stall as it writes several minutes of data at a time.  This
forces Linux to flush its buffers every second instead of every few
minutes and produce slightly better realtime behavior.<P>

<B>SIZE OF CAPTURED FRAME:</B> - This is the size of the frames
recorded.  It is independant of the project frame size because most
video devices only record a fixed frame size.  If the frame size given
here isn't supported by the device it might crash Cinelerra.<P>

<B>FRAME RATE FOR RECORDING:</B> - The frame rate recorded is different
from the project settings.  This sets the recorded frame rate.<P>

<H1>PERFORMANCE</H1>
</CENTER><P>


You'll spend most of your time configuring this section.<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE> 

<B>INDEX FILES GO HERE:</B> - Back in the days when 4 MB/sec was
unearthly speed for a hard drive, index files were introduced to speed
up drawing the audio tracks.  This option determines where index files
are placed on the hard drive.<P>


<B>SIZE OF INDEX FILE:</B> - Determines the size of an index file.
Larger index sizes allow smaller files to be drawn faster while slowing
down the drawing of large files. Smaller index sizes allow large files
to be drawn faster while slowing down small files.<P>

<B>NUMBER OF INDEX FILES TO KEEP:</B> - To keep the index directory from
becoming unruly, old index files are deleted. This determines the
maximum number of index files to keep in the directory.<P>

<B>DELETE ALL INDEXES:</B> - When you change the index size or you want to
clean out excessive index files, this deletes all the index files.<P>

<B>CACHE ITEMS:</B> - To speed up rendering, several assets are kept
open simultaneously. This determines how many are kept open.  A number
too large may exhaust your memory pretty fast and result in a crash.  A
number too small may result in slow playback as assets need to be
reopened more frequently.<P>


<B>SECONDS TO PREROLL RENDERS:</B> - Some effects need a certain amount
of time to settle in.  This sets a number of seconds to render without
writing to disk before the selected region is rendered.  When using the
renderfarm you'll sometimes need to preroll to get seemless transitions
between the jobs.  Every job in a renderfarm is prerolled by this
value.<P>

<B>FORCE SINGLE PROCESSOR USE:</B> - Cinelerra tries to use all
processors on the system by default but sometimes you'll only want to
use one processor, like in a renderfarm client.  This forces only one
processer to be used.  The operating system, however, usually uses the
second processor anyway for disk access so this option is really a 1.25
processor mode.<P>

<A NAME=renderfarm>

<B>RENDER FARM:</B><P> To use the renderfarm set these options.  Ignore
them for a standalone system.<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>USE RENDER FARM FOR RENDERING:</B> - When selected, all the
<B>file->render</B> operations use the renderfarm.<P>

<B>NODES:</B> - Displays all the nodes on the renderfarm and which ones
are active.  Select the <B>ON</B> column to activate and deactivate
nodes.  Select the <B>HOSTNAME</B> and <B>PORT</B> columns to edit a
node.  Computer freaks may be better off editing the
<B>~/.bcast/.Cinelerra_rc</B> file than this if they have hundreds of
nodes.<P>

<B>HOSTNAME:</B> - Edit the hostname of an existing node or enter the
hostname of a new node here.<P>

<B>PORT:</B> - Edit the port of an existing node or enter the
port of a new node here.<P>

<B>REPLACE NODE:</B> - When editing an existing node, hit this to
commit the changes to <B>HOSTNAME</B> and <B>PORT</B>.  The changes
won't be committed if you don't hit this buttoin.<P>

<B>ADD NODE:</B> - Create a new node with the <B>HOSTNAME</B> and
<B>PORT</B> settings.<P>

<B>DELETE NODE:</B> - Deletes whatever node is highlighted in the
<B>NODES</B> list.<P>

<B>SORT NODES:</B> - Sorts the <B>NODES</B> list based on the
hostname.<P>

<B>FILESYSTEM PREFIX ON REMOTE NODES:</B> - Sets the relative location
of all the assets on the nodes.  If the assets are in <B>/mov</B> on
the master and the master filesystem is mounted under <B>/mnt</B> on
the nodes, the filesystem prefix should be <B>/mnt</B>.  Ideally the
assets should appear under the same directory on the nodes as the
master.  In this case the filesystem prefix can be <B>/</B>.<P>

<B>TOTAL JOBS TO CREATE:</B> - Determines the number of jobs to
dispatch to the renderfarm.  The more jobs you create, the more finely
balanced the renderfarm becomes.<P>

<CENTER>
<H1>INTERFACE</H1>
</CENTER><P>

These parameters affect purely how the user interface works.<P>

<B>USE HOURS:MINUTES:SECONDS.XXX</B>Various representations of time are
given.  Select the most convenient one.  The time representation can
also be changed by <B>CTRL</B> clicking on the time ruler.<P>

<B>USE THUMBNAILS:</B> - The Resource Window displays thumbnails of
assets by default.  This can take a long time to set up.  This option
disables the thumbnails.<P>

<B>CLICKING IN/OUT POINTS DOES WHAT:</B> - Cinelerra not only allows
you to perform editing by dragging in/out points but also defines three
seperate operations which occur when you drag an in/out point. For each
mouse button you select the behavior in this window. The usage of each
editing mode is described in editing.<P>

<B>MIN DB FOR METER:</B> - Some sound sources have a lower noise
threshold than others.  Everything below the noise threshold is
meaningless.  This option sets the meters to clip below a certain
level.  Consumer soundcards usually bottom out at -65.  Professional
soundcards bottom out at -90.<P>

<B>FORMAT FOR METER:</B> - This option allows you to select the format
for all the VU meters. If you're a CS major select percentage and if
you're a EE major select DB.<P>

<B>THEME:</B> - Cinelerra supports variable themes.  Select one here
and restart Cinelerra to see it.<P>
