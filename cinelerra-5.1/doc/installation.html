</CENTER><P>

Cinelerra is best installed by downloading an RPM and running<P>

<B>rpm -U --force --nodeps cinelerra*.rpm</B><P>

on a RedHat system.<P>

On systems which don't support RPM look for a utility called
<B>rpm2cpio</B>.  Download a Cinelerra RPM and from the <B>/</B>
directory run<P>

<B>rpm2cpio cinelerra*.rpm | cpio -i --make-directories</B><P>

It should be noted that the compiler used in building Cinelerra
binaries is the free GNU compiler and although it can reorder
instructions for Pentium I and use some the of Pentium II branch
instructions it's 12 years behind most modern CPUs.  You can try
different compilers and optimization flags by compiling the source.<P>

Compiling the source is hard and there's no warranty if the source code
fails to compile, but the method for compiling starts by downloading
the source code and decompressing.<P>

<B>tar jxf cinelerra*.tar.bz2</B><P>

Enter the cinelerra directory<P>

<B>cd cinelerra</B><P>

and set some environment variables.  For Pentium II use:<P>

<B>export CFLAGS='-O3 -march=i686 -fmessage-length=0 -funroll-all-loops -fomit-frame-pointer -malign-loops=2 -malign-jumps=2 -malign-functions=2 -I/usr/local/include'</B><P>

For Pentium I and old AMD's use:<P>

<B>export CFLAGS='-O3 -fmessage-length=0 -funroll-all-loops -fomit-frame-pointer -malign-loops=2 -malign-jumps=2 -malign-functions=2 -I/usr/local/include'</B><P>

Then run<P>

<B>make</B><P>

The make procedure should run through all the directories and put
binaries in the <B>i686</B> directories.  When we originally supported
Alpha it was convenient to compile Alpha and i686 binaries
simultaneously, in different directories.<P>

Once finished run<P>

<B>make install</B><P>

to install the binaries.  The output goes as follows:<P>

Binaries -> <B>/usr/bin</B><BR>
Plugins  -> <B>/usr/lib/cinelerra</B><P>

The main binaries are the Cinelerra executable and several utilities
for reading MPEG transport streams.<P>

Run Cinelerra by running<P>

<B>/usr/bin/cinelerra</B><P>
