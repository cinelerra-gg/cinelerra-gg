Compiling the backups<P>








<P>Be aware the backups come with<P>

<P>

Because installing software in Linux ranges from difficult to
impossible you should consider first why you want to do this to
yourself and second how much better your life will be if you
succeed.<P>


The reason for this system of backups instead of more traditional CVS,
snapshot, IRC room, or rejected slashdot submission is 

<BLOCKQUOTE>

#1 The libraries and tools are very esoteric and useless to most
consumers.  They are no substitute for bona-fide home entertainment
systems.<P>

#2 The libraries and tools are shared across many applications.  Many
esoteric and useless applications, that is.  Changes to the libraries
must be propagated to the applications without involving a hairball of
standard lib directories or cp -a'ing the libraries after every
change.<P>

#3 People hate software that costs money.  People hate free software
that doesn't have support even more.  Only people who like compiling
software instead of retaliating for lack of support are going to bother
compiling backups.<P>

Enter the <I>symbolic linking</I> paradigm.  The biggest reason users
can't understand our development tree structure is that Microsoft is
king and symbolic linking doesn't exist in Windows.<P>

When you symbolically link something, it appears in the directory just
like the original file would, except it's really an illusion.  Changes
made to the original file appear in every symbolic link to it, as if
you changed many copies of the file.<P>

Here's the development tree you need to re-enact on your computer to do
development:<P>

<PRE>
./
./libmpeg3
./quicktime
./cinelerra
./xmovie
</PRE>

The first step in constructing this development tree is downloading the
backups.  The latest version of the following files must be downloaded
and decompressed into ./:<P>

<B>
<PRE>
cinelerra.*.tar.bz2
libmpeg3.*.tar.bz2
quicktime.*.tar.bz2
xmovie.*.tar.bz2
</PRE>
</B>

<P>

The CFLAGS environment variable must be set with optimization flags. 
The best optimization flags are<P>

<B>-O3 -march=i686 -fmessage-length=0
-funroll-all-loops -fomit-frame-pointer -malign-loops=2 -malign-jumps=2
-malign-functions=2</B><P>

You compile Cinelerra by running <B>make</B> and <B>make install</B> in
<B>./cinelerra</B>.<P>

You compile XMovie by running <B>make</B> and <B>make install</B> in
<B>./xmovie</B>.<P>

The executables are currently:<P>

<PRE>
/usr/bin/cinelerra<BR>
/usr/bin/xmovie
</PRE>

The plugins are currently:<P>
<PRE>
/usr/lib/cinelerra/*<BR>
</PRE>
