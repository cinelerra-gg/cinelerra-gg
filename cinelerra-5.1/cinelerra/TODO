BIG BUGS
----------------
Nested EDLs with different colormodels crash.
Effects not getting rendered if multiple effects have random starting times.
Drag effect before timeline is finished drawing after a load -> lockup
Load a sound file.  Change the file on the disk.  Crash on exit.
Change asset path, CPlayback never returns to redraw the frame.






WISH LIST
----------------

Private plugin data storage in the track.
 - save_private(position) & load_private(position) calls
 - the problem is the playback thread doesn't have access to the timeline EDL
 - would need a call to send data back to the timeline EDL
Double click -> select edit -> drag to expand selection by edit
Remove unused files from project and disk.
clear button in error dialog
Option to display full path for assets
custom button bar
 - preferences window with possible buttons and current buttons for the 3 main windows
 - buttons need different implementations for each window because of locking
 - order is fixed
 - drag from possible buttons to current buttons to add
 - drag from current buttons to possible buttons to remove
 - remove icons after dragging out of possible buttons
 - prev/next edit
 - save
 - open
 - record
 - new
 - keyframe straight or curved
 - modify labels
 - modify effects
 - align on frames
undo menu showing previous 20 steps to undo
 - or page in resources window
Page in resources window for overlays
Common service for audio and video drivers.


time stretch rubber band
 - before or after effects

Music synthesis
 - all roads lead to having just audio & video tracks
 - asset or effect

Image synthesis
 - asset or effect
 - particle system
 - track motion of every pixel, determine Z for every pixel
 - track motion for successively smaller macroblocks
 - synthesize picture using cubes and compare




rendering, playback, record settings bound to EDL.
histogram parade - either toggle, different plugin, or plugin replacement
editing in place
Apply motion tracking to another effect or mask.
 - currently involves matchmoving an alpha multiply track
Denoise from mjpeg tools.
 - yuvdeinterlace
Check for output asset being used in project before rendering.
Extended MPEG video support
 - need accurate beginning and ending frames
 - 1: direct copy of MPEG video frames
 - 2: multiplexer settings under audio
 - 3: support program stream using mplex and fifos
 - support transport stream using makets and fifos for mplex when it supports it
 - encode AC3 audio only with video.  6 channel support

Time average with median.
Remove unused resources function.
Session management
Signal handling for non interactive rendering.
Sound level using readahead buffer.
Asset searches.
Asset organization in subfolders.
Field based reverse video.
Zoomblur transition
Zoom transition










NOT GOING TO HAPPEN
---------------------
Hide controls in Record Monitor
Quicktime mp3 needs standards check
 - no need for mp3 anymore
Dissolve doesn't work in YUVA OpenGL
 - not reproducible
Batch filename not saved from recording dialog if cancelled.
 - not reproducible







Not reproducible
----------------------
Quit freezes when background rendering is on.
 - No quit during slow effect with background rendering.
 - Not reproducible.











B
-----------
Doesn't support window managers with user placement of windows.
Remember Asset list position.








On hold

Paste non realtime plugins leading to a dialog box.
