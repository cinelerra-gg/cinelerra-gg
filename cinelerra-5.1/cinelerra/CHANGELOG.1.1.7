Audio and video playback through firewire.  Can't get a playable
audio stream for the camcorder in realtime but the interface is there.

Quicktime: Libraw1394 and grabbing interface removed.  Didn't serve any
purpose since playback requires a completely different mechanism than
record.

Quicktime, XMovie, Cinelerra: ffmpeg decoder used in MPEG-4.  This
gives slightly faster playback but is lousy at seeking.

More file writing recovery from crashes.

Cinelerra: Module dereferences renderengine less often in nonrealtime
effects where renderengine is 0.

Quicktime: Importing of dvgrab and lavtools AVI files.
Cinelerra: Hitting space rapidly doesn't lock up recording as much.
Cinelerra: Resize Render effect window.
Cinelerra: Changing parameters for PCM file works more often.

Cinelerra: tiff upgraded to 3.1.7
Firehose: Fixed bug in firehose reciever.
Cinelerra: Virtual file system for renderfarm.
 - The filesystem prefix for rendering nodes was decidedly useless so it was
discontinued.
Cinelerra: Time stretch based on overlapping windows instead of FFT.
Cinelerra: Freeze frame has line doubling option.

Integrated mpeg2enc, toolame, lame encoding as libraries.
Toolame refurbishment:
 - converted exit to return in main.
 - put prototypes in filempeg.h
 - created input buffer management.
 - forced stdin at all times
 - created error and eof variables.
 - freq2bark -> toolame_freq2bark
mpeg2enc symbol conflicts:
 - putbits -> mpeg2enc_putbits
 - SmpFrqIndex -> toolame_SmpFrqIndex
 - BitrateIndex -> toolame_BitrateIndex

edit and effect titles stay visible at all times.  We'll see how long
this lasts.

long replaced with int64 wherever possible.  After many years of
assuming long would automatically scale to whatever it was compiled on,
it appears more of a pain than a scalability point in matters of
function overloading.

Default configuration should run on stock Redhat 9.0 system.



Patches:
loop-crush.diff applied
exit-crush.diff too much code for no effect
splash-leak.diff applied
overlay-speedup.diff applied
overlay-speedup2.diff applied
titler-stroke.diff
titler-stroke2.diff applied but disabled due to SMP crash. (crush)
	Added Outline style and tumbler.
	Reduced number of exits due to bounds checking errors.


quicktime_leak.diff applied
small-clean2.diff file may be closed and reopened without calling destructor.

patchbay_free.diff applied but the real problem was PatchBay::update()
	dereferenced non-existent tracks to get the ID.


perspective_alpha_stretch.diff applied
virtualconsole_leak.diff applied but the default destructors seem to be
	getting called.
dvlib_bug_workaround.diff applied
debian_new_dvlib_compile.diff applied

multihead_compositor-1.1.5.diff rejected  The X11 parameter in Playback
preferences is the compositor display.

filexml.diff applied
paste-outpoints.diff needs testing

paste-outpoints.diff rejected.  Broke other paste behavior.  The paste
behavior is not a uniform case but the result of trying behaviors on a
case by case basis and deciding which behavior is the most convenient.
Most of the time what's convenient is not the most scientific.








Brief:


Improved playback through firewire.  Importing of dvgrab and lavtools
AVI files.  Changing parameters for PCM works more often.  Virtual file
system for renderfarm.  Time stretch based on overlapping windows
instead of FFT.  Integrated mpeg2enc, toolame, lame encoding as
libraries.  Default configuration should run on stock Redhat 9.0 system.
