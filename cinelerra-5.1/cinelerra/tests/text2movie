KNIGHT

I knew you'd come, but my strength has left me.

AIRFORCE

Who are you?

KNIGHT

The last of 3 sisters who swore an oath to find a marcy a and to guard it.

AIRFORCE

That was 700 years ago.

KNIGHT

A long time to wait.

[pause]

You are strangely dressed for a knight

AIRFORCE

I'm not exactly a knight.  What do you mean?

KNIGHT

# misspelling to get the voice synthesis to work

I was chosen because I was the bravest and the most worthy. The honor
was  mine until another came to challenge me to single combat. I pass a
marcy a to you who vanquished me.



AIRFORCE

What's a marcy a?

KNIGHT

Welcome to a marcy a, what america used to be called before someone
botched the marcy part.


[pause]

But beware, a marcy a can not pass the great seal.  That is the price of
heroine warriorhood.



AIRFORCE

Did you win a marcy a from the british?

KNIGHT

A marcy a came from the concatenation of adam and marcy.

But don't tell the air force that.

KNIGHT

I once dreamed Major Marcy was in a cramped room with an elevator in the
middle, a kitchen on the left and a bed on the right. She was in a group
coming off the elevator, in the middle.

I was trying to find some kind of light next to the bed.  She wasn't in
the group anymore after I returned to the elevator.

AIRFORCE

You dream about Major Marcy too much.

KNIGHT

Major Marcy is all you need to dream about.
