// This should override the stdio commands and inderect operations on any file
// starting with RENDERFARM_FS_PREFIX to the network.

// The server runs on the master node.
// The client runs on the client.

// The traffic shares the same socket as the rest of the rendering traffic
// so the server and client command loops have to give control to the
// VFS objects when they get a VFS command.

// Only one RenderFarmClient can exist per image because the stdio operations
// don't allow pointers to local storage.  Fortunately only one
// RenderFarmClient exists per image by default.  The RenderFarmClient just needs
// to wait until it's forked before creating RenderFarmFSClient.
// The RenderFarmClient is a mutual
// exclusion lock and table of file descriptors.
// It searches through the table to see if the file descriptor is virtual.
// Then it translates a single stdio call at a time to and from
// network commands, complete with the original parameters and return values.

// The RenderFarmFSServer takes one command from the network at a time and passes
// it directly to the stdio call.  If call has a buffer, the buffer is
// created by the RenderFarmFSServer and streamed over the network.
// The return values are passed untouched back through the network.

// FILE* and int on RenderFarmClient are meaningless.
// They can't be dereferenced.
// Unfortunately, nothing else in Cinelerra can override stdio now.

// All the stdio functions are transferred in endian independant ways except
// stat, stat64.
