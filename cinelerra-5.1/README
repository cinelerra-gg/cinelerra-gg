== for configuration help:

  ./configure --help

== for system BUILD install:
  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure --prefix=/usr
  make 2>&1 | tee log
  make install

== for shared BUILD for $HOME/cin install:
  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure --without-system_build
  make >& log
  make install >> log
  grep "\*\*\*.*error" -ai log
  mkdir -p $HOME/cin
  cp -a ./bin/. $HOME/cin/.

== to RUN from $HOME/cin install:
  cd
  ./cin/cinelerra

== Build notes:
Shared builds are not recommended, since system versions of thirdparty
libraries are not always known to be free of problems.  The build
will use known (perhaps patched) libraries if built statically.

The amount of time needed for the build is decreased by adding more
build jobs via --with-jobs=#, the default is 1.5*mach cpus + 2 jobs.
eg. --with-jobs=12

There are several packages which are "forced" either because they
vary widely between systems, or are buggy and have patches in the build.

Using disable-pkg means that the static build is not used, and a system
library will be used to replace it.  
eg. --disable-giflib

Using without-feature means that the feature is omitted from cinelerra.
eg. --without-firewire
